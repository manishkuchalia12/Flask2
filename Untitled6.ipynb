    "Q2. Why is request used in Flask?\n",
    "Ans:-In Flask, the request object is used to access incoming request data when processing a web request. Flask is a micro web framework for Python, and it provides a simple and lightweight way to build web applications. The request object encapsulates the details of an HTTP request made by a client to a Flask application."

    "Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used?\n",

    "Template files in Flask typically have the .html extension, and they are stored in a folder called templates within your Flask project director\n",
    "The render_template() function in Flask is used to render a template and return the corresponding HTML to the client. It takes the name of the template file as its first argument and can also accept additional variables to pass data to the template.y."
